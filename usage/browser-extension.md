The following extensions open YouTube links directly in FreeTube:

- [LibRedirect](https://libredirect.github.io/)
- [RedirectTube](https://github.com/MStankiewiczOfficial/RedirectTube)

LibRedirect automatically redirect YouTube links to FreeTube. To ensure proper functionality, select FreeTube as Frontend in the Services settings of the extension.

RedirectTube, doesnâ€™t automatically open YouTube links in FreeTube. Instead, it adds buttons to the toolbar and context menu, which you can click to open videos in FreeTube manually.

- Download LibRedirect from [Mozilla Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/libredirect/) (for Firefox based-browsers) or [developer's website](https://libredirect.github.io/download_chromium.html) (for Chrome and Chromium-based browsers).

- Download RedirectTube from [Mozilla Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/redirecttube/) (for Firefox based-browsers).

If you have issues with the extension working with FreeTube, please create an issue in the [FreeTube Repository](https://github.com/FreeTubeApp/FreeTube) instead of the extension repository. Most if not all problems is a problem with FreeTube itself and not a problem with the extension.

**These extensions do not work on Linux portable builds!**
